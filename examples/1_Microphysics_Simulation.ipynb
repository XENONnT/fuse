This step is done in the `ChunkInput` plugin and the result can be accessed using target `geant4_interactions`. This plugin used uproot to open the root file and then converts it into numpy arrays. Each event is then assigned a time based on the config option `source_rate`. The plugin will cut delayed interaction and divide the data into chunks if necessary. \n",

First, all interactions are grouped by time and then a DBSCAN algorithm is used to spacially cluster the interactions.
