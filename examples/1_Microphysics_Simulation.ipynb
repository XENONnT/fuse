This step is done in the `ChunkInput` plugin and the result can be accessed using target `geant4_interactions`. This plugin used uproot to open the root file and then converts it into numpy arrays. Each event is then assigned a time based on the config option `source_rate`. The plugin will cut delayed interaction and divide the data into chunks if necessary. \n",

First, all interactions are grouped by time and then a DBSCAN algorithm is used to spacially cluster the interactions. The output of this plugin can be accessed using target `cluster_index` and can be loaded along with the `geant4_interactions`."

The energy of the interactions is summed up and the position and time is calculated as the weighted average of the positions of the individual interactions.

The interaction type is later used to choose the correct emmision model. \n",

The plugin also assigns a `vol_id` to each interaction based on its volume. The volume definitions are stored in a dictionary in fuse.common. \n",

By default, the only selection applied is the volume selection, as defined in the `DefaultSimulation` plugin. However, more complex selections can be defined, for example using the `EnergyCut` plugin to select only events with a certain energy range. The selection logic can be used by registring - as an example - the `LowEnergySimulation` plugin, which inherits from `SelectionMerger` and applies both the volume selection and an energy cut defined in the `EnergyCut` plugin."

This is done in the `ElectricField` plugin using a simulated field map. The field values can be accessed using the target `electric_field_values`. Next we can estimate the number of produced electrons and photons using an emission model. The default implementation of fuse uses the `NestYields` plugin where `nestpy` is used. fuse also provides alternative plugins where the yields are calculated using BBF or a beta response model. These plugins should only be used if you know what you are doing. The result of the emission model can be accessed using the target `quanta`. "
