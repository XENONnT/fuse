This step is done in the `ChunkInput` plugin and the result can be accessed using target `geant4_interactions`. This plugin used uproot to open the root file and then converts it into numpy arrays. Each event is then assigned a time based on the config option `source_rate`. The plugin will cut delayed interaction and devide the data into chunks if necessary. \n",

First, all interactions are grouped by time and then a DBSCAN algorithm is used to spacially cluster the interactions.

This is done in the `ElectricField` plugin using a simulated field map. The field values can be accessed using the target `electric_field_values`. Next we can estimate the number of produced electrons and photons using an emission model. The default implementation of fuse uses the `NestYields` plugin where `nestpy` is used. fuse also provides alternative plugins where the yields are calculated using BBF or a beta response model. These plugins should only be used if you know what you are doing. The result of the emission model can be accessed using the target `quanta`. "
