# Detector Physics Simulation

This collection of plugins simulates the effects specific to the XENONnT TPC. This part of the simulation was formerly handled by WFSim.

The relevant process for the S1 signal is:
- Distribution of S1 photons to the PMTs

The relevant processes for the S2 signal are:
- Electron drift from interaction position to the liquid/gas interface
- Electron extration into the gas phase
- Secondary scintillation
- Distribution of S2 photons to the PMTs
